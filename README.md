# SCATE A DJANGO API WITH DJANGO REST FRAMEWORK
[Django REST framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/) is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.

## Requirements
- Python 3.12
- Django 5.1.2
- Django REST Framework

## Installation
After you cloned the repository, you want to create a virtual environment, so you have a clean python installation.
You can do this by running the command
```


You can install all the required dependencies by running
```

python -m venv env
```

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

python manage.py makemigrations
```

python manage.py migrate
```
python manage.py runserver

## Structure
In a RESTful API, endpoints (URLs) define the structure of the API and how end users access data from our application using the HTTP methods. Endpoints should be logically organized in Post Man collections.
